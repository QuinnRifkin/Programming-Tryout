# Programming-Tryout
	I want to be apart of the 4930 programming system for a number of reasons. First of all, what better way to spend your winter than programming robots? Spending a couple days each week with my friends coding is, in my mind, a great way to spend my time. The second reason is that the reward of seeing a working robot is awesome; without your code it wouldn't be anything except a pile of metal. This makes me feel like my work was not only important, but necessary. The skill of coding is also something that is great to have; the world is moving in an extremely technical direction extremely fast. Knowing how computers and other machines work is not a bad idea. I think my work in computer programming has helped me with this. Continuing this kind of learning seems like a good idea to me, and I think being a part of this team will absolutely help me with it, as it did last year. Last year was a lot of funâ€”and I hope this year will be just as fun. I hope to learn even more about how robots work and more about java in general.
